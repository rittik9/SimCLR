#A PyTorch Implementation Of SimCLR
**Introduction**: 
SimCLR, short for "Simple Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations," is a powerful self-supervised learning framework for learning high-quality image representations without requiring manual labels.It leverages contrastive learning, where the model is trained to pull together similar images and push apart dissimilar ones in a learned feature space.
